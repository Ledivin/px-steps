### Description

A Polymer component that visualizes step sequences and progress made on them.

### Usage (Declarative)

#### Minimum :

    <px-stepper steps="[[steps]]"></px-stepper>

#### Common:

    <px-stepper
        steps="[[steps]]">
    </px-stepper>

#### Complete:
    <style id="px-stepper-custom-styles">
    :host {
    }
    </style>
    <px-stepper
      steps="[[steps]]"
      step-click-event-name="[[stepClickString]]">
    </px-stepper>


### Attributes

#### __steps__

An array that should contain the steps and the details on each.  It has the following structure as demonstrated by this example:

    steps: [
      { id: 1, label: "Basic Information", completed: true, current: false},
      { id: 2, label: "Select Services", completed: true, current: false},
      { id: 3, label: "Billing", completed: false, current: true},
      { id: 4, label: "Review", completed: false, current: false},
      { id: 5, label: "Deploy", completed: false, current: false}
    ]

In the above structure, for each step object: __"id"__ is a unique identifier, __"label"__ is used as the title
for the step, __"completed"__ indicates if a step is completed, and __"current"__ identifies the current step.  While there is no restriction
against having more than one current step, it is more realistic that there is only one current step, and that all steps to previous to the
current one are completed.  A step is not required to be completed or current; it can be neither.
In the above example, the first 2 steps are complete, Step 3 is current and Step 4 is neither completed nor the current step.

#### __completed-step-icon__

The name of the font-awesome icon to be placed inside the step node (which is a circle, by default) for a completed step.

#### __current-step-icon__

The name of the font-awesome icon to be placed inside the step shape (circle, by default) for the current step.

#### __step-click-event-name__

The name of the event that will be dispatched from the browser's __window__ object when a step is clicked on.  When such an
event is dispatched, the Event object will have a __"payload"__ attribute with the following structure:

    Event.payload : {
      "id" : String
    }

In the above, __"id"__ will have the matching id attribute (from the __steps__ array) of the step that was clicked on.


### Styling
The following custom properties are available for styling (shown with their corresponding default values):
